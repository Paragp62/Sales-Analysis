#Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations
#Project Overview.
#The objective is to analyze monthly revenue and order volume trends using SQL aggregation techniques.

--I utilized the Superstore database, which contains an orders table with columns like order_date, sales, order_id, and ship_mode. Using these data points, I analyzed monthly trends in sales and order volume.

#Tools Used
#Database: MySQL
